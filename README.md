# MPROVE UI AND UX DESIGN OF WEB FORMS

For desktop, forms make sure that you have autofocus on the first input field when you open a particular form. Moreover, it's good if you can move between elements with Tab key.

In mobile/tablet experience, it's good to match keypad.Use specific HTML input types to show the correct keypad.

### Mobile and desktop

**input type=”text”** displays the normal mobile device keyboard

**input type=”email”**** displays the normal keyboard plus ‘@’ and ‘.com’

**input type=”tel”** displays the numeric 0-9 keypad

**input type=”number”** displays a keyboard with numbers and symbols

**input type=”password”** this hides characters as they’re typed in the field

**input type=”date”** this displays the mobile’s date selector

**input type=”datetime”** this displays the mobile’s date and time selector.

**input type=”month”** this displays the mobile’s month/year selector
